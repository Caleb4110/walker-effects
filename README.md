# walker-effects
This repository contains A collection of audio plugin effects/instruments 
made by me.

Most are made in C++ using the [JUCE](https://juce.com/) framework.

## Effects
- **Chorus**: A simple stereo chorus effect. Still a major WIP
- **Reverb**: This is a reverb based on Schroeder's reverb algorithm. At the moment it sounds
  quite metallic, and does not have many controls apart from decay. For this effect, i plan to add: a low pass filter in the feedback section to simulate high end roll-off (as actual reverb tends to have) and modulated delay lines to reduce frequency build up (which causes the metallic sound in the reverb)
